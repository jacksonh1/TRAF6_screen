# TRAF6 screening data and analysis
This repository contains data and analysis associated with a manuscript entitled: **Molecular determinants of TRAF6 binding specificity suggest that native interaction partners are not optimized for affinity**. [BioRxiv link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.08.491058v3). The code here was used to perform the analysis detailed in the manuscript. You are welcome to adapt it for your own use, however, it is not intended to be released as a software/tool for general use. If you do have questions you are encouraged to contact Jackson Halpin (jhalpin@mit.edu) and/or Amy Keating (keating@mit.edu), however we cannot off full software support.
